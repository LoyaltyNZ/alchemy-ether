## How to Open an Alchemy-Ether Ticket

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, search for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature or bug fix, be sure to have the existing tests passing, and additional tests for your feature or fix.

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the codebase.

* All pull requests should be made to the `master` branch.
